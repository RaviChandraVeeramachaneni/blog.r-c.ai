# Ravi Chandra Veeramachaneni

**About Me:**

I am a Software Engineer. I love building scalable software and my interest spans in using different algorithms for making systems better & efficient. I am also interested in Machine Learning and want to work at the intersection of both the fields.

Right now, I am learning & building several projects to get my hands on around Machine Learning. My interest has deepened more once I started learning & applying the Deep Learning. I also love to blog what I learn. Blogging to me is having an easy to understand resource, which I wish, I had, when I started learning that topic.

I am passionate about Open source. I love using & contributing to open source frameworks. Also, I love reading variety of topics during my free time and I am currently deepening my knowledge in topics such as parallel universe, dark matter, black holes and few others from Theoretical Physics.
